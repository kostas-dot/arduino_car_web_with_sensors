I'm trying to make an arduino web controlled car that has sersors. The goal is if I press backwards for example and the sensors detect object in a specific distance it doesn't let the car continue. The problem in my code is that if I do it one way it ckecks for the distance only once and if I do it an other way while the function works as intended I can not give an other command. I would like to use recursion but I'm inexperienced in c++ programming. If anyone can help I would be grateful.
